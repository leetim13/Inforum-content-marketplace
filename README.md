## Decision Logs
**Design and UI:** \
From a design perspective, we have decided to prototype our entire UI and high-level architecture using `Figma`, which is intuitive to use and requires not much technical background. Figma also has group sharing functionalities and will thus allow our CSC454 colleagues to  participate in the whole design process.

**React, Redux, Express, Node, ESLint, Jest:** \
We have decided to use this popular stack in web development, because it helps us build a web application from front-end to back-end only using `Javascript`. 
We also chose to use `Jest`, because both `Jest` and `React` are developed and supported by Facebook and will have better compatibility with one another.

**Data Storage (PostgreSQL/Redis):** \
We initially thought of using the popular `MERN` stack but eventually realized that a relational database (`postgreSQL`) would be more appropriate for our use case compared to a NoSQL database (`MongoDB`). As our application requires many different tables (`user`, `mission`, `post`, etc.), relational database will help us enforce data integrity and join tables more easily. 

We have also decided to add `Redis` to our tech stack as an in-memory key-value store for caching purposes, so we can retrieve data such as user-related data in a timely manner.

**Facebook Graph API:** \
We will use Facebook's `Graph API`, which will provide us with key statistics for each user's post (including the # of likes/comments). This will be used to calculate the points each user will get in our reward system.

**Monitoring (Sentry):** \
We have decided to use `Sentry` for error tracking and performance monitoring for both the front-end and back-end of our web application.

**Communication:** \
We have decided to use `Slack` as the primary source of all communication, including video calls and the recording of meeting notes. This is because we want to promote a professional work environment where the slack channel will only be used for work-related discussions.

**CI/CD/Version Control:** \
We have decided to use `Github` as our version control platform, because everyone on the team has professional experiences working with it and that it is free of charge for teams of any size unlike alternatives such as Azure DevOps.

We have decided to use `Github Actions` to set up our continuous integration workflow, including building, testing and deployment. This is because `GitHub` is arealdy used extensively for the entire application development process (commits, issues, branches, etc.).

We decided to use `Heroku` as our container-based cloud platform to deploy and manage our MVP mainly because it is free of charge and `Heroku` integrates with `Github` very well, so we could leverage that for continuous deployments.

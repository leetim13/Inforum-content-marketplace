Diversity in inforum
---

Valuing diversity is crucial to a company’s long term success. A workplace encompassing people from different backgrounds, personalities, and cultures opens up to countless more possibilities and will build upon a culture of trust and respect.

With our initial market focusing on the Canadian population, and with it being so diversified, it is important that we capture the needs of every group of people. All this preparation will also be helpful to us later on when we are ready to scale globally.

### Team Background & Strengths 

With professional experience from 50-person startups to 10,000-employee enterprises, our team has participated in the process of developing and scaling a new product to the global market under a production environment. Even though, physically, we might all be classified under the profile of “Asian males”, we actually came from different areas of the globe, speak different languages at home, and think in entirely different ways. 

Moving to Canada when he was eleven, Wilson brings an immigrant’s perspective to the team. Growing up with the surrounding environment constantly changing, he is an adaptable person and tends to notice every little detail, whether it is on a person or in the codebase. Throughout the time working as a Full-Stack Developer, he developed strong skill sets in the web application area. These skills will be beneficial to the team, when it comes to designing the architecture, implementing features and maintaining CI/CD pipeline across our development life cycle.

Growing up in Taiwan and coming to Canada for the first time for college, Timothy, brings an Eastern mindset and perspective, especially through the lens of both individualistic and collectivist cultures. He also has professional work experience in the pension and banking sector from both the data science and asset management’s standpoint. He will help the team to make more data-driven and data-informed decisions via his domain knowledge.

Samuel immigrated to Canada when he was 3 years old, along with his parents and sister. Samuel has had experience working at 40-person, 200-person, and 2000+ person startups before, so he brings with him a unique view into the different stages in productionizing and monetizing a product. Samuel aims to use this experience and apply it to Inforum’s business and product strategy, working together with Siwon to create a successful business plan with traction. Samuel will also aim to create an extremely inclusive environment where all team members’ opinions are valued and considered. 

Siwon grew up in South Korea until he was 5 years old when his family made the move to Vancouver, Canada. Since then he has moved to Toronto, Ontario to study computer science at the University of Toronto. He has had over a year of experience working in small and large startups in the B2B Saas and fintech space. Through these experiences he has been able to practice building software solutions for different problem areas. He hopes to emulate the success he has seen at Inforum, where he is currently leading the Business and Product side of the team. 

### Blindspots & Weaknesses

We must acknowledge that our team has a few blindspots, including the lack of diversity (more on this in the diversity section below). We also have a limited team size of four  people, which might require us more time and effort especially during the engineering phase. With all of us coming from a computer science background, it makes the conversation easier between the business side and the technical side. But that also means we are constrained within the software developer mindset, and might therefore limit our innovation. As for age, we are all students at U of T and part of the greater Gen-Z population, which could potentially lack perspectives from other age groups. However, this  bias is mitigated as our target population of our product is the Gen-Z and millennial population. 

As for the lack of our technical expertise, we all don’t have prior (professional) experiences in UI/UX design, which could affect the usability of our product, especially to different demographics as mentioned previously. We also have limited insights and knowledge to the various kinds of financial products the banks could offer their customers, which could cause some blindspots when designing our own product. Nevertheless, we plan to address this by consulting frequently with our industry partner, who have a deep understanding on this matter.

### Subject Matter Experts

As none of us have prior experiences in launching a startup, nor are we professionals in the field of Marketing Science, it is important that we constantly seek support from subject matter experts, who can help us address our blindspots and gaps. We will be consulting frequently with our industry partner, RBC, for their domain knowledge and deep understanding of their customers’ behaviours and also our instructors, Mario and Julian, to gain a deeper understanding of product design and the startup lifecycle. We also plan to conduct user-based research with methods like surveys to collect critiques and feedback from our Gen-Z/millenial target market.

### Diversity

Our team has a varied background, but we acknowledge that we do not have people across different genders and ethnicities. This might lead us to introduce some unintended/unconscious biases in our product, which we might not have thought of before. However, because of this, we are devoted to consulting frequently with a more diverse audience (through the forms of surveys or in-person conversations), including but only limited to our peers and classmates, local communities, instructors, and industry partners. This will be done by us proactively initiating conversations and gathering feedback along each step of the startup process, regarding both the development of our final product and also our thought processes-- making sure that we reduce this bias and blindspot to the minimum.

### How this can impact us

We understand that due to the limitations stated above for our team, there might be some potential impact on our final product in terms of unintended biases in product design and development. For example, our product might not be as effective and user-friendly/intuitive to people different from our team’s demographics. But we are determined to mitigate these biases as best as we can by consulting frequently with our subject matter experts, instructors, peers, classmates, and local communities. We take users’ constructive feed-backs very seriously as we believe it is core to a product’s long-term success.

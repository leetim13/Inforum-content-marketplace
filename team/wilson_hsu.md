## About Wilson

Wilson is a fourth year Computer Science undergraduate who just got back from his 12 months PEY at Environment and Climate Change Canada. During the covid year, he devoted most of his off-work time to watching anime and Netflix. Wilson has been trying to lose weight for over 4 years now, so please slap him when you catch him eating fried chicken or drinking bubble tea.

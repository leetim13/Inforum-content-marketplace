Team Principles
---

#### **Communication**:

- Team members will mainly communicate via Slack channel.
- This group chat will only be used professionally to discuss anything project-related
- Team members are expected to check the group chat at least once per day (Monday to Friday, 8am-8pm). The team should also be informed *in advance* if a person will not be able to check the group for any particular reason.
- **Emergencies**: Phone calls will only be made if a team member cannot be reached via Slack. Phone numbers for each team member have already been collected and pinned on the Slack channel.
- We hope to promote and maintain a positive, considerate, and inclusive work environment throughout the entire project.

#### **Meetings**:

- We agreed to hold regular meetings every Wednesday after class. (Online or in person depends on the class).
- Each member is expected to attend every meeting.
- Team members could request a reschedule of the meeting (upon agreement by the rest of the team). The rescheduling request should be made *at least* 2 days in advance.

#### **Work**:
- All changes to the master branch *must* be made via a pull request and reviewed by at least one team member.
- Work will be distributed evenly according to each individual's preferences and/or expertise during each team meeting.
- Team members are encouraged to reach out for help *as early as possible* if faced with a difficulty.
- Github issues will be used extensively for discussions and revisions.
- Each team member is expected to provide an ETA for their individual tasks and is responsible to complete their tasks on time. Any potential delays should be communicated as soon as possible.
- Keep all Issue, Pull Request, Branch name and description clean and concise. 
	- Branch naming convention: {action}-{feature}. 
		- action: `fix`, `add`, `remove` etc.
		- feature: name of the feature or `issue-0000` to represent a Github issue.
 
#### **Other potential issues**:

- We believe *effective and prompt communication* is key to a project's success and we hope to overcome any other potential challenges together as a team.

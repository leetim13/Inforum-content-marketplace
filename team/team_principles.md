Team Principles
---

#### **Communication**:

- Team members will mainly communicate via facebook messenger.
- This group chat will only be used professionally to discuss anything related to this project.
- Team members are expected to check the group chat at least once per day (Monday to Friday, 8am-8pm). The team should also be informed *in advance* if a person will not be able to check the group for any particular reason.
- **Emergencies**: Phone calls will only be made if a team member cannot be reached via messenger.
- We hope to promote and maintain a positive, considerate, and inclusive work environment throughout the entire project.

 #### **Meetings**:

- We aim to hold regular meetings (at least once per week).
- Each member are expected to attend each meetings.
- Team memebers could request a reschedule of the meeting (upon the agreement of the rest of the team). The rescheduling request should be made *at least* 2 days in advance.

#### **Work**:

- All changes *must* be made via a pull request and reviewed by at least one team member.
- Work will be distributed evenly according to each individual's preferences and/or expertise during each team meeting.
- Team members are encouraged to reach out for help *as early as possible* if faced with a difficulty.
- Github issues will be used extensively for discussions and revisions.
- Each team member is expected to provide an ETA for their individual tasks and is responsible to complete their tasks on time. Any potential delays should be communicated as soon as possible.
 
#### **Other potential issues**:

- We believe *effective and prompt communication* is key to a project's success and hope to overcome any other potential blockers togther as one team :)

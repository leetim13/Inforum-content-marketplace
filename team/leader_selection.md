Leader selection
---

#### **Selection Process**:
- In order to ease the process of managing both sides of our company, we came to an agreement that the leader will be chosen from the CSC491 class, hence Wilson and Timothy. 
- Since they have different expertise and there are multiple phases for our project, they will take turns being the leader. 
- Timothy will be the leader when the project is at the data science and modelling phase.
- Wilson will be the leader when the project is at the app architecture/development phase. 

#### **Leader's Responsibility**:
- Proactively reach out to every member to ensure everyone is on track.
- Ensure that there is no workplace discrimination/violation of any kind and that everyone is respectful to each other. 
- Responsible for making the final call on any product and business decisions (especially when there is no consensus between the team members).

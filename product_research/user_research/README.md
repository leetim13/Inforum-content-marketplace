# User Research
## Interviews
User research is conducted in one-on-one interview format. The user will be asked to complete one or all of the following scenarios, while verbalizing their thought process (e.g. “I am trying to find the reward page.. but it’s not .. oh nvm it’s here”). Raw notes/transcripts will also be attached for this section.
The scenarios are as follows:
- Introduction: "Hi, thanks for taking the time to do this user research with us and we will now ask you to perform a series of tasks. Please note that we will try not to answer any questions so please complete the tasks to the best of your ability."
1. "Please find the login page and attempt to log in. Assume you have created a username and password already.”
2. "Please find the instructions page and briefly read through it. Do you think the instructions are clear enough for you to complete your task as a ‘promoter’”? Follow-up: “Can you explain, using a few sentences, how you are able to gain reward points?”
3. “Please browse for all available offers and choose one you are most interested in sharing.”
4. “You have changed your mind. You now wanted to share an offer that contains video content. Please choose such an offer.”
5. “Please now share this offer and follow the instructional prompts along the way”.
6. “Please tell me how many reward points you have at the moment”
7. “Please tell me how many of your posts are still active”

## Discussions
After going over the scenarios we will engage the user in a casual conversation. Note that this will not be transcribed as we try to keep it casual and conversational, but the summarized version of this conversation will be attached. Discussions will revolve around:
- What they thought about the overall design.
- Features they found helpful (or confusing).
- Any challenges they faced or if anything sticks out.
- Any feature that they think would be helpful and we should add.

### Summarized notes from Anonymous User_1 (Female , Age 21):
- [raw notes](./raw_notes_user1.txt)
- Presented scenarios: 1 to 7
- Features they like:
  - “intuitive design” [Scenario 3, 4]
  - “instructions are clear and concise” [Scenario 2]
- Features they found confusing:
  - “can’t find the hidden menu (top-right)” [Scenario 5, 6, 7]
  - “doesn’t understand what “ongoing posts” mean [Scenario 6]
- Features they would want to have:
  - a "settings" page where they will be able to change their email address (for notifications), update their names/phone numbers/credit card information, etc.
  - functional "notifications" that alert users when rewards are distributed. This would happen once the offer has expired and we have verified the validity of the post.
 
### Summarized notes from Julian:
- [raw notes](./raw_notes_Julian.txt)
- Presented scenarios: 1 to 7
- Features they like:
  - "UI is straightforward and easy to use"
- Features they found confusing:
  - Meaning of “ongoing posts” [scenario 6,7]
  - The instructions page has too much information and takes too long to read. Avoid the use of excessive exclamation marks [scenario 2]
  - Choose icons that are intuitive for users (for ‘my rewards’ and ‘settings’. (e.g. the paste icon when pasting the post URL link) [scenario 5]
- Features they would want to have:  
  - Recommend offers filtered/based on user profiles/demographics 
  - Create a prototype page for user insights (from the bank's perspective)
- Recommendations:
  - Side bar could be merged into the header

### Banks Marketing Team

Marketing teams from the banks will use our website to post marketing campaigns in the form of a “mission”. The missions could be in the form of sharing a new product or limited offers/deals, or simply posts/videos the banks want to advertise.

### Banks Machine Learning Team & Data Scientists

Machine Learning teams or data scientists from the banks can view key statistics of each mission to have a better understanding of their marketing strategies and make further improvements. For our MVP, this currently only includes campagin shares by gender/age group and # of likes/clicks. The banks will also have access to each post under each of their own campaigns in case they want to see it in detail.

### Promoters

Each promoter will use our website to view and accept new campaign missions based on their preferences and the missions can also be queried via specific categories/filters. After making a public post on social media, the promoters will then paste the post url (that will contain the unique post id) back on our website, so we can validate the post.

## Long Term

**Duration:** 2022

In year 2022, we intend to implement a Reward Centre for users to redeem their points for rewards such as Amazon or Starbucks gift card. We will also expand our supported platform and post formats to text based social medias like Twitter, LinkedIn and image/video based social medias like Instagram or Tiktok. Lastly, to better guard against malicious behaviours, we will integrate bot detection and CAPTCHA to minimize the possibility of exploits on our website.
